<p class="page_explanation">
	Here you can know more about me as a developer.
</p>

<h1>As a professional</h1>
<p>
	I'm a mobile developer since 2010 in Bordeaux, France. I started as an iOs developer (Objective C). The Apple's OS is still my specilism.
</p>
<p>
	On several occasion worked on other platform like Windows Phone (C#/XAML) and Bada (C++) without deep knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	I also worked on back offices and I was able to developed some web skills both on server side (Django, Php) and client side (JQuery, Html, Sass).
</p>
<p>
	As you can see I am a multi-platform and multi language developer (with a specilism in iOs).
</p>
<h1>My personal projects</h1>
<p>
	My personal projects are less on mobile platform (I like to change my mind) and more on desktop. As I use Windows on my computer I develop some util tools for my personal use in C# (the most time).
</p>
<p>
	My number one passion is video games so naturally I started some game developement. For now it's just one of my hobby. I like to test all the engines I'm finding but my favorite is Unity 3D for the language (C#) and the game object specific component system. The framework is also pretty easy to use.
</p>
<p>
	For a long time I was just trying to develop for myself but now I would like to show my skills and improve them. I'm not a mobile gamer so most of my games are PC or console type ones.
